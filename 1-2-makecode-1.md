# Introduction to MakeCode

## Step 1 @showdialog

Welcome to MakeCode for Spark:bit. Inside the Spark:bit is a microcontroller called the micro:bit that has buttons, sensors, LEDs, and wireless capabilites, in addition to all the inputs and outputs that connect to the Spark:bit. MakeCode includes programming blocks that enable you to write software programs using all of the inputs and outputs to the Spark:bit.

There are four main parts of the MakeCode editor:
* Toolbox - holds all of the coding blocks and is organized into different categories
* Workspace - is where you will drag the coding blocks and build your program
* micro:bit Simulator - enables you to run some of your code on a virtual micro:bit. However, it does not simulate the Spark:bit inputs and outputs.
* Download Button - is how you will download your program to run on the Spark:bit
